# CSE 204 - Object Oriented Programming I: Java Lab

This repo is for the CSE 204: Object Oriented Programming I: Java Lab course at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Asia Pacific. This repo specifically contains the Lab Reports that was assigned throughout the course. There are a total of 8 Lab Reports and each progesses into becoming a single project in **Lab Report 8**. Obviously the Lab Reports are written in the Java programming language.

## Course Description

This course introduces the students to the basic concepts of object-oriented programming using Java. The course covers the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The course also covers the basic concepts of Java programming, such as data types, operators, control structures, arrays, strings, and exception handling.
